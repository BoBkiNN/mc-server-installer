This is an utility written in python that allows creating server manifests declaring plugins and other assets for easy share and install.

# Manifest

Manifest is a text file where user describes plugin list using providers system.<br>
Manifest consists of several fields:
- `mc_version`: Minecraft version that server uses, for example `1.21.8`
- `core`: declaration of server core to use
- `mods`: list of mod asset declarations. Placed into `mods` folder
- `plugin`: list of plugin asset declarations. Placed into `plugins` folder
- `datapacks`: list of datapack asset declarations. Placed into `world/datapacks` folder
- `customs`: list of custom asset declarations. Folder where they will be placed is configured manually

### Asset
An asset is unit of mod/plugin/datapack/custom.
Each asset has a:
- `type` that declares which provider to use
- `file_selector` - key or object that defines which files are downloaded by provider
- `asset_id` - and unique id of this asset, based on type-specific properties if not set manually
- `caching` - Enables or disables caching for this asset
- `actions` - List of actions to execute on downloaded data for correct installation using expression templates
- `folder` - folder where asset will be downloaded. Used only by custom assets

### Provider
Provider is a some service or method used to perform downloading and update checking for asset.

Currently available providers:
- `modrinth`: Downloads assets from https://modrinth.com
- `github`: Downloads assets from Github releases
- `github-actions`: Downloads assets from Github actions
- `url`: Downloads single file from some HTTP url
- `jenkins`: Downloads assets from specified jenkins job

Also there are special provider named `note`. It does not have any installation or update checking methods so its only purpose it to log some notice to end user, for example, telling manual installation instructions for plugin that cannot be downloaded using available providers.

### Actions
Action is an operation that runs after downloading file and can be used to perform some installation steps. It uses an expression templates to insert values into text.

For example, you can rename downloaded file:
```json5
{
    type: "rename",
    to: "ProtocolLib-${{data.tag_name}}.jar"
}
```

Above example is used in pair with `github` provider to rename `ProtocolLib.jar` to `ProtocolLib-<version>.jar`

Each action has an optional `if` field which can contain python expression (dont misconcept with template expressions) that returns boolean value. When it specified, action will be run only if check if passed. For example, this action will log `Hello world!` if there are only single file downloaded:
```json5
{
    type: "dummy",
    if: "len(data.files) == 1"
    expr: "'Hello world!'"
}
```

#### Action types:
Currently, there are 3 action types which you can use:  
- `dummy` - Logs expression result into install log that can be seen while installing.  
- `rename` - Renames primary file of data to specified file name
- `unzip` - Unpacks primary file into specified folder. If folder is not set, unpacks archive to same folder where downloaded file is located. Supports `.zip`



#### Template expressions
Template expressions is flexible and simple way to insert values into text. Insipired by Github Actions, expressions are enclosed in `${{` and `}}` characters. When needed, you can escape expression by adding `\` before `$`.<br>
Expressions in brackets must be valid python code that gives some value that will be inserted into text.

There are two variables that is exposed in template expressions used in `actions` list:  
- `data` (`d`) - Is an object reflecting data downloaded by provider. Different providers have different data types. For example, `github` provider has `GithubReleaseData` which has `repo` and `release` fields which is objects from [PyGithub](https://pypi.org/project/PyGithub/) library. Also each data type has `files`, `primary_files` and `first_file` properties that contains downloaded file path(s) relative to server folder.
- `asset` (`a`) - Is an object mirroring asset declaration that specified in manifest 

# Installation and running
There are 3 `.pyz` files in each release and you need to pick most closest to you:
- `mcsi-ver.pyz`: A pure python archive, without any dependencies. Instead, all dependencies from [requirements.txt](mcsi/requirements.txt) must be installed
- `mcsi-ver-win.pyz`: A python archive that contains dependencies to work on Windows
- `mcsi-ver-linux.pyz`: A python archive that contains dependencies to work on Linux-like systems (e.g Ubuntu or Debian)

To run this files you need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your computer.

## Usage
Command syntax is `python mcsi-ver-os.pyz <command> <args>`.

Currently there are 3 commands, each doing a set of actions:
- `install`: Primary command used to install server. It seraches for manifest file in current folder (or uses specified using args) and installs server to specified folder (defaults to current folder)
- `update`: Uses installation cache for check asset for updates. Dry mode can be enabled to perform update check without installation.
- `schema`: Can be used to generate `manifest_schema.json`

You can see usage for any command by adding `--help` argument

Examle minimal command:  
`python mcsi-2.1.2-win.pyz install --manifest myserver.json5`  
This command above uses `myserver.json5` manifest file to install server into current folder.

# Writing you own manifest
The primary requirements is knowledge of language in which manifest is written, this docs and having an IDE, like Visual Studio Code.

## Selecting language
First step is to choose an language in what you will write manifest:

Currently there are several languages supported that can be used to write manifest:
- `JSON`
- `JSONC`: JSON with comments
- `JSON5`: Easy and flexible JSON, examples used here are written in it.
- `YAML`: `.yml` or `.yaml` files

Then you can create a document with that extension and open it in your IDE

## Attaching schema
Schema is description of document which used by IDE to provide you documentation on available fields, values and options

To attach a schema you must find the link to `manifest_schema` and insert it into document in place supported by your IDE. The most common way is using JSON-like language:
```json5
{
    $schema: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoBkiNN/mc-server-installer/refs/tags/2.1.2/mcsi/manifest_schema.json"
    // rest of your manifest
}
```

## Actual writing
Now, when you attached a schema, you can use IDE suggestions to fill you manifest

# TODO
Plans for new features and improvements in this project:
- Move action types to registry
- Improve and structurize core installation logic
- Better way of passing authorization data and using it in assets
- Manifest metadata about creator and etc
- Provide example manifest
- Hangar support
